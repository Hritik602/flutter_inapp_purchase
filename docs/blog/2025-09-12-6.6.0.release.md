# 6.6.0 Release

Short and sweet — this release brings the Android migration to openiap-google, tighter null-safety, and example stability fixes.

## Highlights

- Android: Switched to openiap-google with coroutine-based connection gating and improved error logging.
- Dart: More robust product parsing and safer generics to avoid UI stalls.
- iOS: Added small helper methods (subscription group, App Store country, typed app transaction, histories).
- Example: Guarded mounted across async paths to prevent setState after dispose.
- Tooling: Pre-commit formatting matches CI; avoids staging untracked files.
