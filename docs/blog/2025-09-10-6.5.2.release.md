Shipped 6.5.2 with a small but important iOS fix and a safer CocoaPods pin.

Highlights

- Fix: tolerate numeric iOS values for product/discount prices (prevents “type 'double' is not a subtype of type 'String?'”), fixes #547
- iOS: pin OpenIAP Apple pod to exact `openiap 1.1.9` to avoid unexpected minor bumps
- No breaking changes

Notes

- After upgrading, run `cd example/ios && pod install` to refresh the lockfile.
- See CHANGELOG for details.

Thanks to everyone who reported and helped validate the fix!
